the user interface may be worked on i think this would still help the interoperabiity of the website, as the white fonts and black bg , the font color should probably be whitesmoke and some font sizes are unnecesarily big on desktop mode , kindly see to this too. 
i can help with those and i would love to contribute as a community member , i love initia.
